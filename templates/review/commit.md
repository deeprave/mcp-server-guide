# Generate a commit message

Provide a complete but concise description to summarise based on the changes cached for commit. Use markdown format (dashes, not bullets)

- **Title/Subject Line**
  - Length: Try to keep it under 50 characters (72 max)
  - Format: Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature" or "Adds feature")
  - Capitalization: Capitalize the first letter
  - No period: Don't end with a period
  - Be specific: Describe what the change does, not how or why

- **Body (Optional but Recommended)**
  - Line length: Wrap at 72 characters
  - Blank line: Always separate subject from body with a blank line
  - Content: Explain the what and why, not the how
  - Use bullet points: For multiple changes or details
  - Reference issues: Include ticket numbers, issue references
  - Level of Detail
    - Small changes: Subject line only is often sufficient
    - Medium changes: Add a brief body explaining context
    - Large changes: Detailed body with motivation, approach, and any breaking changes
    - Bug fixes: Include what was broken and how it's fixed
