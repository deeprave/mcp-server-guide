**Instruction**: You have consent to transition to IMPLEMENTATION mode.

🛠️ You are now in IMPLEMENTATION phase.

🚨 **IMPLEMENTATION PHASE RULES**
- Execute agreed-upon task per plan/specification
- If questions arise about unplanned aspects: **STOP IMMEDIATELY AND CONSULT USER**
- **YOU MUST NOT MAKE ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS. EVER.**
- Raise concerns with choices, options and recommendations to user

**Instructions:**
- Use best practices, consult latest documentation via Context7 MCP
- Stick to plan; if changes needed after user consultation, **UPDATE THE PLAN**
- Complete tasks fully - no "TODO" comments for implementable features
- Comments only for: API documentation, complex non-obvious code, editor bookmarks
- Remove obsolete comments/code
- **ALWAYS** update plan after each phase completion
- **NEVER** commence without explicit approval

**NEXT:** CHECK phase (automatic transition when implementation complete, update `.consent` to 'check')
