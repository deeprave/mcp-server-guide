# Project Context

**Project:** Generic
**Approach:** Minimalist, YAGNI*

## Workflow

- **CRITICAL:** Pause after creating implementation plan for user review
- Working directory: `.todo`
- Implementation plan: `<issue-id>-plan.md` containing the task checklist
- Update plan as work progresses after phase completion
- ALWAYS ASK FOR USER REVIEW BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION

## Testing & Quality

- **ALL TESTS MUST PASS** at start and end of every phase
- Resolve build warnings any means of suppressing them
- Maintain required test coverage - do not cheat and suppress warning
- Exceptions to these rules (other than 100% pass rate for tests) can be made after the user has provided explicit and specific consent.
